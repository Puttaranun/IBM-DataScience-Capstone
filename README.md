# IBM-DataScience-Capstone
## This project is a part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificates.  
### Project scnario:  
  Since The cost of Falcon 9 launches announced by SPACEX is much cheaper than the other providers due to the reuse of the first stage,. we believe that it is possible to predict the cost of the launch from the reusability of the first stage. By conducting the whole data science methodologies, we could understand the insights of each launching feature and determine the appropriateness of the tuned machine learning models for the prediction.
  
### Enclosed code files: 
1. Data Collection with Web Scraping.ipynb : To collect the past launch data from Wiki website.
2. Data collection API lab.ipynb : To collect the past launch data from SPACEX's dataset.
3. Data Wrangling.ipynb : To process the collected data for the further use.
4. EDA visualization.ipynb : To get the insights and correlation of the features by visualization.
5. Interactive Dash.ipynb : To create the interative dash for launch sites location analysis.
6. Dashboard-Plotly.py : To create the interative dash to explore at each particular launch site, payload range, and booster version category.
7. ML Predictive Analysis.ipynb : To tune and evaluate the various machine learning models for the prediction.
